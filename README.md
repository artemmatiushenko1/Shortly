# Frontend Mentor - URL shortening API landing page

This is my solution to the [URL shortening API landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/url-shortening-api-landing-page-2ce3ob-G).

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:
- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- Shorten any valid URL
- See a list of their shortened links, even after refreshing the browser
- Copy the shortened link to their clipboard in a single click
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if the input field is empty
